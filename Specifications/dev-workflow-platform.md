# Development Workflow Platform Specification

## Overview

A web application that manages the full software development lifecycle — from feature request intake through AI-assisted triage, human approval, development cycle management, to deployment and documentation.

## System Architecture

```
[Input Sources] → [Contributions Intake] → [AI Voting/Triage] → [Human Approval]
   (Manual,          (unified funnel)        (multiple agents      (final gate)
    Zendesk,                                  + FR Writer agent)
    Competitor,                                      ↓
    Code Review)                               [Denied FRs]
                                                                        ↓
[Bug Reports] ← [Running System] ← [CI/CD] ← [Development Cycle] ← [Approved FRs + Bugs]
      ↓                                               ↓
 [Bug List]                                      [Doc Updates]
                                                 [Learnings]
                                                 [Feature Browser]
```

### Subsystem Interaction Flows

The 7 subsystems form a closed loop. Data flows between them as follows:

1. **SS-1 → SS-2**: Potential FRs from intake are forwarded to AI Voting & Triage
2. **SS-2 → SS-3**: FRs with majority-approve votes are presented for Human Approval; majority-denied FRs are archived
3. **SS-3 → SS-5**: Human-approved FRs enter the priority backlog and feed into the Development Cycle
4. **SS-4 → SS-5**: Bug reports enter the priority backlog (with higher priority than FRs) and feed into the Development Cycle
5. **SS-5 → SS-6**: Completed cycles (passed smoke test) trigger CI/CD deployment
6. **SS-5 → SS-7**: Completed cycles produce documentation updates, learnings, and feature catalog entries
7. **SS-6 → SS-4**: Failed deployments automatically create bug reports (feedback loop)
8. **SS-6 → Running System**: Successful deployments update the running system status
9. **Running System → SS-4**: The running system can generate bug reports (runtime errors, monitoring alerts)

## Subsystem Specifications

### SS-1: Feature Request Intake

Feature requests arrive from multiple external sources and are collected into a unified **contributions intake funnel** before entering the pipeline.

**Sources:**
- **Manual**: Users submit FRs directly through the UI
- **Zendesk**: Integration pulls customer requests (simulated in v1)
- **Competitor Analysis**: Integration pulls competitive intelligence (simulated in v1)
- **Code Review**: Tool-built code review suggestions (simulated in v1)

All sources converge into a single contributions queue. Each contribution is tagged with its source for traceability.

**Rules:**
- All FRs enter as `potential` status regardless of source
- Duplicate detection: FRs with >80% title similarity should be flagged (using simple string similarity — Levenshtein or Jaccard; no external ML dependency)
- Each FR must have at minimum a title and description
- Source tag is required and must be one of the defined source types

### SS-2: AI Voting & Triage

Multiple AI agents independently vote on potential feature requests. The voting process includes refinement and prioritization of FRs.

**Feature Request Writer Agent:**
Before voting begins, a "Feature Request Writer" agent refines the FR by:
- Clarifying the description to explain the product context and rationale
- Adding structured detail (use cases, expected behavior, constraints)
- The refined description replaces the original (original is preserved in history)
- This step is simulated in v1 (deterministic text enrichment, not a real LLM call)

**Voting Process:**
- Each potential FR goes through a voting round
- At least 3 AI agent votes are simulated per FR
- Each vote includes a decision (approve/deny) and a comment with reasoning
- Agents evaluate from multiple angles: technical feasibility, business value, resource cost, user impact
- Majority vote determines outcome: majority approve → FR proceeds to Human Approval, majority deny → `denied`
- Voting must be testable: the simulation must support injectable randomness or a fixed seed for deterministic test outcomes
- Voting results are recorded and visible in the UI

### SS-3: Human Approval

After AI voting approves an FR, a human must give final approval before development begins.

**Rules:**
- Only `voting`-complete FRs with majority-approve can be presented for human approval
- Human can approve, deny, or send back for re-voting with comments
- Approved FRs move to the backlog ordered by priority
- Denied FRs are archived with the denial reason

### SS-4: Bug Tracking

Bug reports flow from the running system into a prioritized bug list.

**Rules:**
- **Bugs take priority** over feature requests in the development cycle
- All items in the current cycle must complete before picking up the next work item
- Bug severity determines priority ordering
- Bugs can also be created manually through the UI

### SS-5: Development Cycle

The core workflow loop. Each cycle processes one work item (bug or approved FR) through a structured pipeline.

**Phases:**
1. **Make Changes to Spec**: Document what specification changes are needed
2. **Break Out Tickets**: Decompose the work item into implementation tickets
3. **Implementation Loop** (per ticket):
   - Get next ticket
   - Make changes (implementation)
   - Code Review (automated check)
   - PR Tests Pass (test verification)
   - Security Agent (security scan)
4. **Reviewer Test Changes**: Final review of all changes
5. **Smoke Test**: End-to-end validation

**Rules:**
- Only one active development cycle at a time
- Bugs take priority — if a bug arrives during FR development, it should be queued as next
- All tickets in a cycle must complete before the cycle is marked done
- Failed reviews send the ticket back to implementation

**Pipeline Orchestration (SS-5a):**

Development cycles are orchestrated through the TheATeam agent pipeline. When a cycle is created, it is linked to a pipeline run that tracks progress through 5 stages:

1. **Requirements Review** (requirements-reviewer) → completes spec_changes phase
2. **API Contract** (api-contract) → advances to ticket_breakdown phase
3. **Implementation** (backend-coder, frontend-coder) → advances to implementation phase, then review
4. **QA** (chaos-tester, security-qa, traceability-reporter, visual-playwright, qa-review-and-tests) → advances to smoke_test
5. **Integration** (design-critic, integration-reviewer) → triggers cycle completion

Each stage completion automatically advances the linked cycle phase. The work item (FR or bug) status updates alongside the cycle. Pipeline-linked cycles cannot be manually advanced via PATCH; they progress only through stage completions.

**Pipeline Entities:**
- **PipelineRun**: Tracks the overall orchestration (id: RUN-XXXX, linked to cycle)
- **PipelineStage**: Tracks individual stages (stage_number, status, verdict, agent_ids)

**Traceability (SS-5b):**

All artifacts created during a development cycle maintain full traceability:

1. **Tickets** carry a `work_item_ref` linking them to the parent FR or bug, plus optional `issue_description` and `considered_fixes` for structured problem documentation
2. **Bugs** raised during a cycle (e.g., deployment failures) carry `related_work_item_id`, `related_work_item_type`, and `related_cycle_id` linking back to the parent work item and cycle
3. **Features** produced on cycle completion carry `cycle_id` and an optional `traceability_report` (FR coverage and test mapping generated by the traceability-reporter agent)
4. **Cycle Feedback** entries capture team findings (QA rejections, security findings, design suggestions) as first-class records linked to the cycle and optionally to specific tickets
5. **Dev cycle detail** includes the team name and all feedback entries for full visibility

**Selection Priority (unchanged):**
1. Triaged bugs, ordered by severity (critical > high > medium > low), then oldest
2. Approved feature requests, ordered by priority, then oldest

### SS-6: CI/CD Integration

Completed development cycles trigger deployment.

**Rules:**
- Successful smoke tests trigger a "deployment" (simulated in v1)
- Deployment updates the running system status
- Failed deployments create a bug report automatically

### SS-7: Documentation & Learnings

Each completed cycle produces documentation updates and captures learnings.

**Outputs:**
- **Doc Updates**: Summary of what changed and why
- **Learnings**: Process, technical, or domain insights captured during the cycle
- **Feature Browser**: Searchable catalog of implemented features

## UI Requirements

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3 (simple, no external deps)
- **Testing**: Vitest for both backend and frontend
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript interfaces in Source/Shared/

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Structured JSON logging (not console.log)
- Prometheus metrics at GET /metrics
- OpenTelemetry tracing for critical paths
- All list endpoints return `{data: T[]}` wrappers
- No hardcoded secrets — use .env
- Service layer between routes and database

## Conceptual Entities (Not Persisted)

### Running System
The running system represents the deployed state of the application after a CI/CD deployment. It is not a database entity but a conceptual node in the architecture:
- Receives deployment updates from SS-6 (CI/CD Integration)
- Can generate bug reports back to SS-4 (Bug Tracking) via runtime errors or monitoring alerts
- In v1, the running system is simulated — deployment success/failure is a flag on cycle completion

## Functional Requirements

Each requirement is identified by `FR-XXX` and is the canonical reference for `// Verifies: FR-XXX` traceability comments in source code and tests.

|----|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| FR-dependency-types | Shared types in `portal/Shared/types.ts`: `DependencyLink`, `DependencyItemType`, `RESOLVED_STATUSES`, `DISPATCH_TRIGGER_STATUSES`, `parseItemId`, `ReadyResponse`, `DependencyActionRequest`; `pending_dependencies` added to `BugStatus` and `FeatureRequestStatus` | [fullstack] | Types compile; both portal layers import from portal/Shared/; pending_dependencies accepted by status-handling code |
| FR-dependency-api-types | `UpdateBugInput` and `UpdateFeatureRequestInput` in `portal/Shared/api.ts` include `blocked_by?: string[]`; no `as any` casts needed in frontend for dependency fields | [fullstack] | TypeScript compiles cleanly; PATCH body type-safe end-to-end |
| FR-dependency-schema | `dependencies` junction table in portal/Backend schema: `id`, `blocked_item_type`, `blocked_item_id`, `blocker_item_type`, `blocker_item_id`, `created_at`; unique constraint + bidirectional indexes; idempotent migration | [backend] | Table and indexes present on startup; migration safe to run multiple times |
| FR-dependency-service | `DependencyService` class: `addDependency` (self-ref check, existence check, BFS cycle detection), `removeDependency`, `getBlockedBy`, `getBlocks`, `hasUnresolvedBlockers`, `isReady`, `detectCycle`, `onItemCompleted` (cascade auto-dispatch), `setDependencies` (bulk replace) | [backend] | BFS detects transitive cycles; bulk replace is atomic; cascade correctly identifies and auto-dispatches newly-unblocked items |
| FR-dependency-dispatch-gating | Status transitions to `approved`/`in_development` check all blockers; unresolved blockers → set to `pending_dependencies` instead; completing/resolving an item triggers cascade re-evaluation of dependents | [backend] | PATCH to approved with unresolved blocker → 200 with status=`pending_dependencies`; resolving blocker → dependent auto-advances to `approved` |
| FR-dependency-endpoints | `POST /api/{type}/:id/dependencies` (add/remove single link); `GET /api/{type}/:id/ready`; list endpoints include `has_unresolved_blockers`; detail endpoints include resolved `blocked_by[]` and `blocks[]`; PATCH accepts `blocked_by?: string[]` | [backend] | All endpoints functional; readiness returns correct state; dependency arrays resolved with title+status |
| FR-dependency-search | `GET /api/search?q=` cross-entity search across bugs and feature requests; used by DependencyPicker typeahead | [backend] | Query filters by title/description across both entity types; returns `{data: [...]}` wrapper |
| FR-dependency-metrics | Prometheus metrics: `dependencyOperations` counter, `dispatchGatingEvents` counter, `dependencyCheckDuration` histogram, `cycleDetectionEvents` counter | [backend] | All 4 metrics visible at `GET /metrics`; labels correct per operation |
| FR-dependency-seed | Idempotent seed data: BUG-0010 blocked_by BUG-0003/0004/0005/0006/0007; FR-0004 blocked_by FR-0003; FR-0005 blocked_by FR-0002; FR-0007 blocked_by FR-0003; seeded after base items exist | [backend] | Seeding is idempotent; known dependencies present after fresh setup; GET on seeded items returns correct blocked_by arrays |
| FR-dependency-backend-tests | Tests covering: add/remove link, cross-type deps, circular rejection (409), bulk PATCH, self-ref rejection, readiness check, dispatch gating, cascade auto-dispatch, 404 on unknown item | [backend] | All test cases pass with `// Verifies: FR-dependency-*` traceability comments |
| FR-dependency-api-client | Frontend API functions: `addDependency`, `removeDependency`, `setDependencies`, `checkReady`, `searchItems` | [frontend] | Typed functions cover all dependency endpoints; consistent error handling |
| FR-dependency-blocked-badge | `BlockedBadge` component: red badge for `has_unresolved_blockers=true`; amber for `status='pending_dependencies'`; renders nothing otherwise | [frontend] | Correct badge/color per state; no badge for clean items |
| FR-dependency-section | `DependencySection` component: "Blocked By" and "Blocks" subsections; clickable chips with status-colored badge; "Edit Dependencies" button when editable; unresolved blockers highlighted in pending_dependencies state | [frontend] | Both subsections render; chip click navigates; edit opens picker; pending state highlights correctly |
| FR-dependency-picker | `DependencyPicker` modal: search typeahead across bugs+FRs; add/remove chips; save via PATCH blocked_by; client-side guard warns on direct circular dependency | [frontend] | Search returns results; save calls correct API; direct-cycle warning fires |
| FR-dependency-integration | `DependencySection` integrated in BugDetail and FeatureRequestDetail; `BlockedBadge` integrated in BugList and FeatureRequestList | [frontend] | Section and badge visible in correct views |
| FR-dependency-frontend-tests | `DependencySection.test.tsx` and `BlockedBadge.test.tsx` in portal/Frontend/tests/ | [frontend] | Components render correctly per state; each test has `// Verifies: FR-dependency-*` comment |
